Feature Engineering for Real-Time ML Pipelines: Traditional vs. RLM
Overview
This repository demonstrates two approaches to feature engineering for real-time machine learning pipelines:

Traditional Feature Engineering: Manual extraction and transformation of features from real-time data streams (e.g., Kafka).

Modern RLM Approach: Using Regression Language Models (RLMs) to predict outcomes directly from raw, structured text representations of system state, eliminating manual feature engineering.

Both examples are designed for real-time data ingestion from an MLOps pipeline (e.g., Kafka topic).
